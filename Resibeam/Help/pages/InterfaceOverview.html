<p>BEAM LIST:<br/>
The BEAM LIST is the left most column of the application and provides the opportunity to set the span (length) of the beam as well as a several other geometric properties that are used for the calculation of deflection and the presentation of the deflection graph.</p>

<p>LOAD DATA PANEL:<br/>
This panel provides a view of the data for the currently selected load. This panel also provides several butttons to add new loads and to edit and delete existing loads.</p>

<p>LOAD LIST:<br/>
This panel provides the a listing of all of loads that have been applied to the beam. The loads can be reordered, which will affect their display location in the load diagram pane.</p>

<p>LOAD DIAGRAM VIEW:<br/>
This view shows a graphical representation of all of the loads that have been added to the beam. The beam currently selected in the load list will be blue, while the remainder of the loads will be brown.</p>

<p>SHEAR, MOMENT &amp; DEFLECTION GRAPHS:<br/>
These views show graphs of the respective items for the length of the beam. The green horizontal line represents the beam. The red line graph respresents the summation of all of the respective forces for all of the loads. The blue graph line represents the graph for the single load currently selected in the load list panel. Any grey line graphs are graphs of individual loads.</p>

<p>Values that result from either an induvidual load or values that result from the summation of all of loads may be shown on the graphs, based upon the radio selection at the top of the middle pane.</p>

<p>CURRENT MATERIAL SELECTION:<br/>
The user can select Wood, Steel W (W section) or Steel L (Angle Section), in order to get the resultant stresses in the loaded member.</p>

<p>SECTION GEOMETRY PANEL:<br/>
Based upon the selection in the Current Material Selection Pane, different options will be available in the geometry panel. For wood, either standard lumber sections or a custom selection can be selected. For Steel options, only standard steel sections can be selected.</p>

<p>GRADE PANEL:<br/>
Again different options will be available for selection based upon the material selected. The grade of material will be the basis for the allowable stresses for the beam.</p>

<p>ADJUSTMENT FACTORS:<br/>
This pane allows further adjustments to the allowable stresses.</p>

<p>STRESS RESULTS:<br/>
This table shows the allowable bending stresses (Fb) and the acutal bending stresses (fb) in psi, the allowable shear stresses (Fv) and actual shear stress (fv) in psi, and also the allowable deflection alongside the actual deflections.</p>

<p>Any bending stress, shear stress or deflection in the member that exceeds the design limits will be shown in red. Currently the delfection limit is set at L/240 for the beam deflection with all of the loads applied.</p>
