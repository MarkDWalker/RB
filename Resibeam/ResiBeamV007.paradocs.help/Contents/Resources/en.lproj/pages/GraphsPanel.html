The graphs panels (listed from top to bottom) show the following information:</p>

<p>LOAD DIAGRAM:<br/>
Load diagram shows the beam and a representation of the applied loads.</p>

<p>SHEAR DIAGRAM: <br/>
Shear diagram showS a shear graph for all of the individual loads applied as well as a combination of all of the loads applied.</p>

<p>MOMENT DIAGRAM: <br/>
Moment diagram showS a moment graph for all of the individual loads applied as well as a combination of all of the loads applied.</p>

<p>DEFLECTION DIAGRAM: <br/>
Deflection diagram showing a deflection graph for all of the individual loads applied as well as a combination of all of the loads applied. Note that the deflection diagram values are based upon the moment of inertia and modulus of elasticity values entered in the Beam Geometry Panel.</p>

<p>VALUE LABELS:<br/>
The program is able to label the values of the shear, moment, and deflection diagrams along the beam. By default, the graph showing the total of all the loads combined is shown. To view the labels for an individual load, select a load in the load list panel, and select the appropriate radio button at the top of the graphs panel.</p>

<p>Additionaly the results for shear, moment and deflection can be viewed in tabular format by selecting the appropriate button at the top of the graphs panel. v will show the shear, m will show the moment, and d will show the deflection. These tabular results can show either the total results of all the loads (default) or the values for each individual loads. To view the individual loads, select the load in the load list panel and select the appropriate radio button at the top of the graphs panel.</p>
