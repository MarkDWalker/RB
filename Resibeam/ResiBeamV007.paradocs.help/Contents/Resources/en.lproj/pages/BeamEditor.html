<p>The beam editor displays the data related to the beam geometry and is to be modified to by the user to fit the desired conditions.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: <br/>
A short string identifier for the beam.</p>

<p>BEAM LENGTH: <br/>
The length of the beam and beam span in feet. Must be a positve number.</p>

<p>SUPPORT LOCATION 1:<br/>
The Location of the first support in feet.</p>

<p>SUPPORT LOCATION 2:<br/>
The location of the second support in feet.</p>

<p>M OF INT (I):<br/>
User input value for the moment of inertia of the beam in inches<sup>4</sup>. This value is used for the calculation of the deflection graph.</p>

<p>MOD OF EL (E): <br/>
User input value for the modulus of elasticity of the beam. This value is used for the calculation of the deflection graph. The input value must be in kips per square inch.</p>

<p>NO. OF DATA PTS.: <br/>
This must be a positive whole number. This represents the number of data points that are calculated for the graph. The minimum number is 3, as at least a point at the beginning of the beam, the middle of the beam and the end of the beam is required.</p>

<p>Ideally, an odd number of data points should be used, as this will give a data point at the midpoint of the beam. Also, the larger the value for this field, the more accurate the graph will be, however, a larger value can affect performance.</p>
